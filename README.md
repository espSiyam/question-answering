# question-answering

It basically finds most similar question and answer relevant to the question. 

For this task, I've used **Sentence Similarity** library, Sentence-Transformers pretrained model **(distilbert-base-uncased)**, **sentence_embedding** for embedding and **cosine** as a similarity metric.
